# european_countries

This game is built using Python, Turtle and Pandas. 

- This game tests the knowledge of user to see how many European countries they know.  
- When the user guesses correctly, the name of the country will appear on the map.
- If the user can list all 41 european countries' names, then they win.  
- The number of correct answers has been tracked for better user experience.  
- If the user types a wrong country name (include incorrect spelling)  
  or the country name has already been guessed, there is nothing happen. That will not count.
- When the user stucks, they can type "exit" to quit the game. 
- A new file with all of remaining countries will be exported to a new CSV file
